J Scripts
=========

I'm learning [J](http://jsoftware.com). These scripts will follow my progress as I attempt to do useful things and generally stumble my way into learning the language. It's pretty fun so far. I really appreciate the consistency of the language, and programming at the function level is very eye-opening.

This script demonstrates some of J's abilities to work [with files](http://www.jsoftware.com/docs/help803/dictionary/dx001.htm).

Example output:


    ┌──────┐
    │hi.ijs│
    └──────┘

    #!/usr/bin/jc
    NB. obligatory

    stdout 'hello world from J' NB. print the words 'hello world from J' to stdout

    echo'' NB. print newline
    exit''
