J Scripts
=========

I'm learning [J](http://jsoftware.com). These scripts will follow my progress as I attempt to do useful things and generally stumble my way into learning the language. It's pretty fun so far. I really appreciate the consistency of the language, and programming at the function level is very eye-opening.
