J Scripts
=========
I'm learning [J][jlang].  These scripts will follow my progress as I attempt to do useful things and generally stumble my way into learning the language.  It's pretty fun so far.

Some highlights:

pych/
-----
Working my way through the [Python Challenges][pych] using "J when I can, Python when I must" (paraphrased Google [motto][alexquote]).  Don't look in here unless you want spoilers.

greatCircleWavelength
---------------------
First calculates the great-circle distance between two latitude/longitude pairs, then the number of wavelengths within that distance of a particular FM radio station.

mortgage
--------
Calculates a monthly mortgage payment using the most common/popular formula, with some initial assumptions about term, interest rate, etc. Convenient while house-shopping.

nums
----
Some of the (many!) ways to represent a number in J.  Currently used as a test for [syntax highlighting][syntax].

skittish
--------
A codegolf question, ["A Skittish Program"][skittish].
