<b>Release Notes for the Image3 Addon</b><br>
by Zachary X. Reiter and Clifford A. Reiter<br>
June 2003<br>
<p>
Some minor changes were required due to differences between J5.01a and J5.01b and J5.02a. 
Those, and some other minor changes are described in 
<a href="release3c.html">Image 3 addon release notes for J5.02a</a>
</p><p>
Like the other releases of the image addon for J, this addon gives utilities for reading and writing images in a variety of formats
from J. While the emphasis is on 24 bit images, there is some support for movies and 8-bit images. We have found the addon very useful and use it regularly. However, some variants of the image and movie types may not be successfully read. Moreover, the software is powerful, so users should be prudent and work on files that have been backed up. 
</p><p>
The main utilities are organized into 4 scripts:<br>
<i>image3.ijs</i>, <i>movie3.ijs</i>, <i>html_gallery8.ijs</i>, and <i>prevare.ijs</i><br>
See the Image3 lab and other help files for details.

<li> Simple Quicktime (tm) movies are supported (*.mov); these include sequences of *.jpg and *.png's. This makes the libraries much larger. </li>
