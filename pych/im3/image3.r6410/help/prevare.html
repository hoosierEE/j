The image3 addon script, <tt>prevare.ijs</tt>, combines many of the most commonly used facilties of the image addon scripts on an interactive form, as illustrated above. 

<p>Typical use:</p>
<p><tt>prevare images_in 'pathname'</tt></p>
<p>which loads the form with the images in the path listed. Any list of image and filenames may be used and supported animation types may be included. </p>
<dir><b>Main features</b></dir>
<ul>
<li>A list of the input files appears in a list from which images may be selected</li>
<li>The list of image files may be augmented by indivdual images or images in a directory (list menu)</li>
