by Zachary X. Reiter and Clifford A. Reiter<br>
August 2001<br>
<br>
Like the first release of the image addon, this addon <br>
gives utilities for reading and writing some 24 bit image<br>
formats from J. Html image gallery building tools are<br>
included. See the scripts and the <tt>image2.ijt</tt> lab <br>
for documentation.<br>
</p><p>
Major changes in Release 2

Revised choice of open source code for jpeg and png<br>

in the same manner.<br>
</p><p>

<li>Png read/writes are dramatically faster</li>
<li>Library file smaller (win image1: three ddls totaled 656k<br>
                         win image2: one dll totals 288k)</li>
