<b>Release 3 of the Image Addon: Help Front Page</b><br>

June 2003<br>
<p>
Like the other releases of the image addon for J, this addon gives utilities for reading and writing images in a variety of formats
from J. While the emphasis is on 24 bit images, there is some support for movies and 8-bit images. We have found the addon very useful and use it regularly. However, some variants of the image and movie types may not be successfully read. Moreover, the software is powerful, so users should be prudent and work on files that have been backed up. 
</p><p>
<p><b>The Main Scripts</b></p>
The main utilities are organized into 4 scripts (each requiring those above it):
<ul>
<li><i>image3.ijs</i> which has functions for reading and writing most of the supported image formats.</li>
<li><i>movie3.ijs</i> which has functions for reading and writing quicktime (tm) movies which are jpeg or png sequences, and some support for <i>*.avi</i> files.</li>
<li><i>html_gallery8.ijs</i> which has functions for automatically creating or updating galleries of images.</li>
<li><i>prevare.ijs</i> which is a form that provides tools handy for interactively preparing, previewing, creating and supplementing the html galleries.</li>
</ul> 
The addon utilities are implemented with a combination of  J defined functions and 
<i>*.dll</i> or <i>*.so</i> library functions created from several open sources. There are also several auxilary scripts used for a variety of tasks: viewing images and data, creating raster images of text, wrapping images onto an annulus for CD labels, and giving samples of possible usage.
</p><p>
