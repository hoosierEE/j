<b>Release Notes for the Image3 Addon; minor changes for J5.02a</b><br>
by Zachary X. Reiter and Clifford A. Reiter<br>
June 2003<br>
<p>
The release J5.02a changed the technique for referencing the addon path names, so these have been updated. Also, some auxiliary scripts have been added. These include:
<ul>
<li><i>filter1.ijs</i> which gives some filters for correcting image defects. See the examples at the end of the script.</li>
<li><i>color_space.ijs</i> which gives tools for converting between color spaces. See the examples at the end of the script.</li>
<li><i>transform_m.ijs</i> which gives tools for correcting barrel distortion and doing tilt and small rotation adjustments. See <a href="transform_m.html">Transform Image help file</a></li>

</ul>
